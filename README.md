# Extension Commands

This plugin provides additional SVN-specific commands that extend asdf's functionality:

```shell
# Show SVN repository information for the current directory or specified path
asdf svn repo-info [path]
# [path] is optional. If not provided, the command defaults to the current directory.

# Clean up an SVN working copy that may be in an inconsistent state
asdf svn clean [path]
# [path] is optional. If not provided, the command defaults to the current directory.
```

For standard version management, use the built-in asdf commands:
- `asdf list-all svn` - List all available SVN versions
- `asdf list svn` - List installed SVN versions
- `asdf current svn` - Show current SVN version
- `asdf where svn` - Show installation path
